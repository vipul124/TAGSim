# TAGSim: Topic-Informed Attention Guided Similarity
This is the official GitHub repository for the implementation of the paper "**TAGSim: Topic-Informed Attention Guided Similarity
Metric for Image Caption Comparison**".

## Requirements
- torch>=2.1.2
- transformers>=4.36.2
- scikit-learn>=1.3.2
- tensorflow>=2.15.0
- scipy>=1.11.4
- numpy>=1.24.4

## Installation
You can install this package using the following command. Also, the mentioned requirements and dependencies are automatically installed using this.
```
pip install git+https://github.com/vipul124/TAGSim.git
```

## Dataset
The test datasets that we used for evaluation purposes are made available in the [dataset](/dataset) folder. Datasets used for training of [TAGSim-base](/TAGSim/models/TAGSim-base) model are not uploaded due to size constraints.

## Uses
### How to train model using your own dataset?
To train your model using our approach, you'll need to choose the following parameters.
- `dataPath` - this is a necessary parameter. You need to mention the path of the JSON train file containing an array of $n \times 2 \times 2$ dimensions (A sample train file is provided [here]())
- `bertModel` (optional) - the name of the LLM model you want to use to generate embeddings. By default, we are using __bert-base-multilingual-cased__ model. For the complete list of available models, you can [refer this](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.3.1/pretrained_models.html)
- `tfModel` (optional) - architecture of the model in `tensorflow.keras.models` format ([sample](https://github.com/vipul124/TAGSim/blob/main/TAGSim/training.py#L12-L17))
- `simModel` (optional) - similarity function.
- `epochs` (optional) - number of epochs. Default - 10.
```python
from TAGSim import trainModel, saveModel

myModel = trainModel(dataPath=dataPath, bertModel=bertModel, tfModel=tfModel, simModel=simModel, epochs=epochs)
saveModel(myModel, "name_of_model")
```

### Loading & using your model
Here is an example of how to load and use the model to determine the semantic similarity of sentences.
```python
from TAGSim import loadModel
from TAGSim.utils import get_line_vector
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoTokenizer

# loading our metric model and downloading LLM models for embeddings
model = loadModel(model='TAGSim-base')
LLM_model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased', output_hidden_states=True, from_tf=False)
LLM_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-multilingual-cased', output_hidden_states=True, from_tf=False)

# calculating semantic similarity
sentences = [
    ["The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog near the river bank", "A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog by the river"],
    ["Mathematics involves solving complex equations and proofs", "The tropical rainforest is rich with diverse animal species"]
]
embeddings = np.array([[get_line_vector(s[0], LLM_tokenizer, LLM_model), get_line_vector(s[1], LLM_tokenizer, LLM_model)] for s in sentences])
similarity = model.predict(embeddings)
print("{} - {}\n{} - {}".format(sentences[0], similarity[0], sentences[1], similarity[1]))
```

### Testing your model
Here is the approach for evaluating the model.
- `dataPath` - this is a necessary parameter. You need to mention the path of the JSON test file (testing datasets are available [here](/dataset))
- `modelPath` - this is a necessary parameter. You need to mention the path of your model folder here (ex: `'models/TAGSim-base'`)
- `bertModel` (optional) - the name of the LLM model you want to use to generate embeddings. By default, we are using __bert-base-multilingual-cased__ model. For the complete list of available models, you can [refer this](https://huggingface.co/transformers/v3.3.1/pretrained_models.html)
```python
from TAGSim import testModel

testModel(dataPath=dataPath, modelPath=modelPath, bertModel=bertModel)
```
